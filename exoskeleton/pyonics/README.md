# pyonics
A Python software library made to simplify the design, testing and production workflow of bionic products. Relies
heavily on the Klamp't library developed starting at Duke. First few versions are going to be designed around
modeling McKibben muscles, and biomechanics like those encountered in humanoid robots.

Submodules include apps, audio, control, network, ui, and video. The intent is that users should be able to import the
whole library as a full-featured suite of integrated tools designed to create custom operating systems, or import
particular submodules if they only want specific functionality.

Thanks to Dr. Paul Savala, my research advisor, for support in developing this library.

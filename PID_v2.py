    I think the index should be separate from the time values. Physics should 
    be based on time independent of the index so that I can have a consistent 
    indexing scheme regardless of the time resolution of the data.

    the GUI but otherwise the front end is ready for a presentation. Adding
    the fractional calculus functionality will be next.
